Dear %%first_name%%,

A great number of students struggle to master critical foundational skills in mathematics. As they continue to fall behind, more help is needed. We would like to partner with you to accelerate your students to grade-level success. We offer two effective solutions with high ESSA ratings that are helping students with math difficulties achieve mastery:

Vmath® is a supplemental math instruction that complements core instruction by targeting and reinforcing the challenging grade-level concepts students struggle with the most.
